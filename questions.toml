Docstrings document functions and other Python objects. A docstring is a
string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function,
class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the .__doc__ special
attribute of that object. See PEP 257 for more information.

There's no built-in @docstring decorator. Many functions naturally return
strings. Such a feature can therefore not be used for docstrings.
